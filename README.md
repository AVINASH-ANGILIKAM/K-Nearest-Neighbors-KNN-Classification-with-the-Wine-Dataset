# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification with Wine Dataset

This project demonstrates the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Wine dataset, using different distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Minkowski). The dataset is used to classify wines based on various chemical properties. The aim is to explore how the choice of distance metric and the number of neighbors (k) affect the performance of the KNN classifier.

## Introduction

In this project, we implement the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to classify wines based on chemical features. The dataset used is the **Wine dataset**, a well-known dataset available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

We experiment with different distance metrics and varying the number of nearest neighbors (k) to assess how these factors influence the model's accuracy. The goal is to provide an easy-to-understand explanation of the KNN algorithm and how to optimize it for better performance.

### Key Features:
- **KNN Implementation**: Implements KNN classification using **Euclidean**, **Manhattan**, and **Minkowski** distance metrics.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measures accuracy of the model with different values of `k`.
- **Wine Dataset**: Classifies wines into three categories based on chemical attributes.
  
## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed. Additionally, you will need some dependencies which can be installed via `pip`.

### Dependencies:
- `scikit-learn`: A machine learning library used for KNN and model evaluation.
